    "# üìä Historical Backtest Engine: Mathematical Framework & Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ **Core Philosophy & Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Historical Backtest Engine operates on the principle of **realistic simulation** - every calculation mirrors real-world margin trading mechanics with institutional-grade precision. Unlike simplified backtests that ignore borrowing costs and margin requirements, this engine models the complete lifecycle of a leveraged position with daily granularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üèóÔ∏è **Data Architecture & Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Primary Data Sources**\n",
    "The engine uses your `ETFs and Fed Funds Data.xlsx` as the authoritative source, containing:\n",
    "- **Daily ETF Prices**: SPY and VTI closing prices\n",
    "- **Dividend Payments**: Quarterly dividend distributions  \n",
    "- **Fed Funds Rates**: Historical Federal Reserve rates for realistic interest calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Processing Logic**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Data Flow: Excel ‚Üí Pandas DataFrame ‚Üí Date-Indexed Time Series ‚Üí Daily Simulation Loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The system converts all data to datetime-indexed pandas DataFrames, enabling efficient vectorized operations and precise date-based filtering for any user-specified backtest period.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚öñÔ∏è **Margin Account Mechanics**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Account Type Specifications**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reg-T Account (Regulation T):**\n",
    "- **Maximum Leverage**: 2:1 (50% initial margin requirement)\n",
    "- **Maintenance Margin**: 25% of position value\n",
    "- **Interest Rate**: Fed Funds Rate + 1.5% spread\n",
    "\n",
    "**Portfolio Margin Account:**\n",
    "- **Maximum Leverage**: 7:1 (dynamic initial margin requirement)\n",
    "- **Maintenance Margin**: 15% of position value  \n",
    "- **Interest Rate**: Fed Funds Rate + 2.0% spread (higher due to increased risk)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Initial Position Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user specifies an investment amount and leverage, the system calculates:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Cash Investment} = \\frac{\\text{Total Position Size}}{\\text{Leverage Ratio}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Margin Loan} = \\text{Total Position Size} - \\text{Cash Investment}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Initial Shares} = \\frac{\\text{Total Position Size}}{\\text{Initial ETF Price}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: $10M position with 4x leverage\n",
    "- Cash Investment = $10M √∑ 4 = $2.5M\n",
    "- Margin Loan = $10M - $2.5M = $7.5M  \n",
    "- Shares (if SPY = $400) = $10M √∑ $400 = 25,000 shares\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí∞ **Interest Rate Calculations**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dynamic Interest Rate Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "The system uses **real historical Fed Funds rates** rather than static assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Daily Margin Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Fed Funds Rate} + \\text{Account Spread}}{365}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Daily Interest Cost} = \\text{Outstanding Margin Loan} \\times \\text{Daily Margin Rate}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Compounding Effect**\n",
    "\n",
    "Interest compounds daily, meaning the margin loan grows continuously:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{New Margin Loan} = \\text{Previous Margin Loan} + \\text{Daily Interest Cost}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a realistic cost structure where longer holding periods and higher leverage dramatically impact returns through cumulative interest expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìà **Dividend Reinvestment Logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Automatic Reinvestment Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "When dividends are paid (typically quarterly), the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculates Dividend Income**:\n",
    "   $$\\text{Dividend Received} = \\text{Current Shares} \\times \\text{Dividend Per Share}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reinvests Immediately**:\n",
    "   $$\\text{Additional Shares} = \\frac{\\text{Dividend Received}}{\\text{Current ETF Price}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Updates Share Count**:\n",
    "   $$\\text{New Total Shares} = \\text{Previous Shares} + \\text{Additional Shares}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This compounding effect means the position grows over time, increasing both potential gains and margin requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîç **Daily Portfolio Valuation**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Core Portfolio Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each trading day, the system recalculates:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Portfolio Value} = \\text{Current Shares} \\times \\text{Current ETF Price}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Equity} = \\text{Portfolio Value} - \\text{Outstanding Margin Loan}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Leverage Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Portfolio Value}}{\\text{Equity}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Maintenance Margin Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Required Maintenance Margin} = \\text{Portfolio Value} \\times \\text{Maintenance \\%}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where Maintenance % = 25% for Reg-T, 15% for Portfolio Margin\n",
    "\n",
    "## üö® **Margin Call Detection**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Margin Call Trigger Condition**\n",
    "\n",
    "A margin call occurs when:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Current Equity} < \\text{Required Maintenance Margin}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Margin Call Price Calculation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The system calculates the ETF price at which a margin call would trigger:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Margin Call Price} = \\frac{\\text{Outstanding Margin Loan}}{\\text{Current Shares} \\times (1 - \\text{Maintenance \\%})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This forward-looking calculation helps assess risk before it materializes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä **Performance Metrics Calculations**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Total Return**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Total Return \\%} = \\frac{\\text{Final Equity} - \\text{Initial Cash Investment}}{\\text{Initial Cash Investment}} \\times 100$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{CAGR \\%} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Final Equity}}{\\text{Initial Cash Investment}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\text{Years}}} - 1 \\times 100$$\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Maximum Drawdown**\n",

    "$$\\text{Drawdown}_t = \\frac{\\text{Equity}_t - \\text{Peak Equity}_t}{\\text{Peak Equity}_t} \\times 100$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Maximum Drawdown} = \\min(\\text{All Drawdowns})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Peak Equity is the rolling maximum equity value up to time t.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Annual Volatility**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Daily Returns}_t = \\frac{\\text{Equity}_t - \\text{Equity}_{t-1}}{\\text{Equity}_{t-1}}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "For each trading day, the engine executes this sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Market Data**: Get ETF price, dividend payment, Fed Funds rate\n",
    "2. **Calculate Interest**: Apply daily interest to outstanding margin loan\n",
    "3. **Process Dividends**: If dividend paid, reinvest automatically\n",
    "4. **Update Portfolio**: Recalculate portfolio value and equity\n",
    "5. **Check Margin**: Determine if margin call triggered\n",
    "6. **Store Results**: Save all metrics for analysis and visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "### **State Persistence**\n",
    "\n",
    "Critical state variables carry forward between days:\n",

    "### **Multi-Dimensional Risk Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "The engine evaluates risk across several dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Leverage Risk**: Higher leverage amplifies both gains and losses\n",
    "2. **Interest Rate Risk**: Rising rates increase borrowing costs\n",
    "3. **Market Risk**: ETF price volatility affects margin requirements\n",
    "4. **Liquidity Risk**: Margin calls may force disadvantageous timing\n",

    "### **Risk Indicators**\n",
