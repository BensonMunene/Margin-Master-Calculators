    "## 📊 Margin Call Detection Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "**A margin call occurs when: `Current Equity < Maintenance Margin Required`**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Detailed Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Equity Calculation:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Current Equity = Portfolio Value - Margin Loan\n",
    "Portfolio Value = Shares Held × Current ETF Price\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maintenance Margin Required:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Maintenance Margin Required = Portfolio Value × Maintenance Margin Percentage\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maintenance Margin Percentages by Account Type:**\n",
    "- **Reg-T Account (Long)**: 25% of portfolio value\n",
    "- **Portfolio Margin (Long)**: 15% of portfolio value  \n",
    "- **Reg-T Account (Short)**: 30% of portfolio value\n",
    "- **Portfolio Margin (Short)**: 20% of portfolio value\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Example:\n",
    "Let's say you have:\n",
    "- Portfolio Value: $2,000,000\n",
    "- Margin Loan: $1,600,000  \n",
    "- Current Equity: $400,000\n",
    "- Reg-T Account (25% maintenance)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maintenance Margin Required:** $2,000,000 × 25% = $500,000\n",
    "\n",
    "**Margin Call Check:** $400,000 < $500,000 → **MARGIN CALL TRIGGERED** ❌\n",

    "Here's the **exact margin call rule** the historical backtest uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚨 Margin Call Trigger Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Primary Rule:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "is_margin_call = current_equity_in_position < maintenance_margin_required\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Variable Definitions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Equity:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "current_equity_in_position = portfolio_value - margin_loan\n",
    "portfolio_value = shares_held * current_price\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maintenance Margin Required:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "maintenance_margin_required = portfolio_value * (maintenance_margin_pct / 100.0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maintenance Margin Percentages:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# From calculate_margin_params() function:\n",
    "if account_type == 'reg_t':\n",
    "    maintenance_margin_pct = 25.0  # 25% for Reg-T accounts\n",
    "else:  # portfolio margin\n",
    "    maintenance_margin_pct = 15.0  # 15% for Portfolio Margin accounts\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **Margin Call Price Formula**\n",
    "\n",
    "The app also calculates the **exact price** at which a margin call would trigger:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "margin_call_price = margin_loan / (shares_held * (1 - maintenance_margin_pct / 100.0))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Real Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have:\n",
    "- **Account**: Reg-T (25% maintenance requirement)\n",
    "- **Shares Held**: 10,000 shares\n",
    "- **Current Price**: $400/share  \n",
    "- **Portfolio Value**: $4,000,000\n",
    "- **Margin Loan**: $3,200,000\n",
    "- **Current Equity**: $800,000\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maintenance Margin Required:** $4,000,000 × 25% = **$1,000,000**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Margin Call Check:** $800,000 < $1,000,000 → **🚨 MARGIN CALL TRIGGERED!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Margin Call Price:** $3,200,000 ÷ (10,000 × 0.75) = **$426.67**\n",
    "\n",
    "So if the ETF price drops to $426.67 or below, you get margin called.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 **Daily Sequence:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Update Interest**: Add daily interest to margin loan\n",
    "2. **Reinvest Dividends**: Buy more shares with dividend payments  \n",
    "3. **Calculate Current Equity**: Portfolio Value - Updated Margin Loan\n",
    "4. **Check Maintenance**: Is Current Equity < 25% of Portfolio Value?\n",
    "5. **If YES** → **IMMEDIATE LIQUIDATION** → Wait 2 days → Re-enter with remaining equity\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule runs **every single trading day** throughout the entire backtest period!"
